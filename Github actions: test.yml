# Github actions: is a tool to automate SDE workflows, you can write individual tasks called actions and combine them to create a custom workflows(WF).
# A WF is custom automated process that can setup in repository, to build, test, package, release or deploy any code on github.
# -> like push, pull(opened, merged),issue (created, closed), scheduled, external event - these are events
# WF is a bunch of actions.
# WF's runs on vms on github server, they contain one or more jobs and each job runs on its own vm.
# Each jobs has certain steps, like action, shell commands ....
# jobs can run parlell or depend on each other

# *Runner: responsible for running jobs whenever event occurs and displays results, runner can be hosted by github or individual host
# github hosted (restrict on h/w): runs on github server, will have some preinstalled s/w's (curl,git,npm,yarn,pip | python, ruby, nodejs | android sdk, xcode)and maintained by github

# WF's are written in YAML format, its a serialization language, similar to JSON

#* Tabs are not allowed in YAML
#* to write a workflow , we have to create yaml file inside a folder called workflows (.github)
